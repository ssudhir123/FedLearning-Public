# Blockchain Learning

This article covers ( a non-exhaustive ) list of available content, educational blogs, videos, tutorials, podcasts etc. It is very well possible that some of the more popular ones are missing in this, so please do update if you think others could be benefitted from those.

### Foundational Whitepapers

* [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) This is the genesis of all development, so worth reading it. 
* [Ethereum whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) This is a good paper if you want to understand Ethereum implementation from the first principles.
* [Ethereum Yellowpaper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) This paper is for core engineering and technology members but others can read if time/inclination.
* [Ethereum documentation website](https://ethereum.org/en/) Ethereum documentation site has significantly improved over the last few years. Definitely worth a read for both technology and non-technology audience. I liked some hands-on tutorials. A walk-through of [ERC20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/erc20-annotated-code/) is nice.

### Short tutorials

* [Binance academy](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles?page=1&tags=blockchain)   Most folks know Binance as a crypto exchange, but they have done a good job at putting some content around blockhain and crypto. Most of the aritcles have a TLDR version with details in the subsquent sections.
 An interesting is on [bridges](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/three-popular-crypto-bridges-and-how-they-work).
* [Blockchain 101](https://101blockchains.com/) This is good if one is looking for cerifications etc. Some courses can be downloaded, along with blogs etc.

### Blogs, videos and articles
* [Consensys](https://consensys.net/blog/)
* [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/blog) Covers a range of topics in blockchain and crypto space. For more technical folks, the [engineering](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/landing/engineering) section has interesting content.
* [Patrick Collins Smart Contract Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ) Patrick has done a phenomenal job in this extended tutorial, and amusing too. Definitely worth watching and doing hands-on development along with it.
* [Finematics explainers on DeFi Concepts](https://www.youtube.com/@Finematics) The short videos on different technical topics, technical analysis of technical events, hacks, etc. Love the explainers from the first principles. Perhaps the best explainer on [FTX incident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uN46EsSBQw).

### Security
* [Trail of bits](https://blog.trailofbits.com/) A security firm that specializes in smart contract audits, security engieering etc.
* [Consensys Due Dilligence](https://consensys.net/diligence/) Consensys has decent work in producing good content, publications, research articles, and blogs that cover several blockchain topics. Their write-up [smart contract best practices](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/) is definitely worth reading for smart contract developers.


### Defi
* [Defi Pulse](https://www.defipulse.com/) -  A combination of news, content and list of available Defi protocols along with their TVL ( total value locked) on different platforms and chains.
* [Explore dApps](https://ethereum.org/en/dapps/#explore) Before you think you got an "amazing and novel" dApp idea, please be sure to visit the list of [publicly available dApps ](https://ethereum.org/en/dapps/#explore)that folks have already deployed on public chains. Chances are that one that you kept secret for a long time is already public -:( 

### Podcasts
* [Zero Knowledge podcast](https://zeroknowledge.fm/) Although the name says zero knowledge, but not all topics are zKP technology. Anna( its host) and guest go at the fundamental explainers rather than buzzwords. 
* [Unchained](https://unchainedpodcast.com/) Laura was a forbes journalist prior to becoming a full time crypto journalist. The content and the discussion are not very technical but is good for current affairs awareness.
* [New to crypto](https://newtocrypto.io/) Mostly 5-7 mins short podcasts that cover several buzzwords in crypto space.
* [Defiant](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-defiant-defi-podcast/id1512654905) A combination of technial and non-technical topics in cryto and blockchain space.
* [Epicenter](https://epicenter.tv/) - Technical and non-technical content around crypto.
* [Bankless](http://podcast.banklesshq.com/) A combination of current state analysis, some technical content and a roll-up of differnt events in the crypto markets.

### News Aggregator

* [Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/)
* [Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/)
* [Messari](https://messari.io/) ( some research content is free)
* [Block](https://blockworks.co/)
* [Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/)

### Structured Courses:
* [Blockchain council](https://www.blockchain-council.org/)
* [SUNY buffalo course](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/home/academics/beyond/online/moocs/blockchain.html)

### Hands-on Developement
* [dApp University](https://www.dappuniversity.com/) It has some nice multi-part tutorials that cover end-2-end working solutions on stable coins, building your own crypto-currency, developing a fully dApp from scratch etc.
* [Learn Blockchain by Building your own](https://github.com/satwikkansal/python_blockchain_app) Instead of reading white papers and others content, why not write your own blockchain and your own consens algorithm. With basic python knowledge, you can write a ( overly simplified )vesion of a fully functional blockchain.

### Conferences:
* [Ethereum developer conference](https://www.youtube.com/@EthereumFoundation)
* [Eth*(Cities )](https://www.ethdenver.com/) -EthDener, EthParis etc
